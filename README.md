<!---
thefwordboss/thefwordboss is a ✨ fairly down to earth, yet a bit touched, possibly broken, maybe even a little special too✨ repository because its pretty much the only thing to need to learn especially if you want to learn without others trying to predetermine / and or dictate what exactly that should be and how`README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes. Also I kinda suspect I may or may not be being surveiled with out my knowledge but that's just a creepy vibe that has in no way any legs to stand on unless you count gut feelings
